Various Travelling Salesman Problem
Supervisor: Zang Wenan (Chair Professor of HKU Maths Department)
- Investigate fundamental concepts in graph theory such as spanning trees, matchings, and bonds. Develop a deep understanding of how these structures are utilized in the formulation and solution of various optimization problems.
- Explore key theoretical frameworks in computational complexity, with an emphasis on the definitions and implications of NP and NP-hard classifications. This includes understanding the boundary and the significance of these classes in computational theory.
- Conduct detailed studies on classic approximation algorithms, mainly focusing on Christofides' algorithm. This task involves reconstructing the proof to understand the foundational mathematics and the algorithm’s approach to achieving approximation guarantees
- Apply problem transformation techniques to investigate how the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) can assist in designing efficient algorithms for the set cover problem and the shortest superstring problem.
- Reconstruct the code for algorithms; run numerical analysis on the performance of approximation algorithms including Christofides and quick insertion, comparing them against the brute force method for TSP. Analyze the length of routes they return and the time consumed.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
